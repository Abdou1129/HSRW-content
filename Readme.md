# T&B Content

**Summer Semester**: 4th semester modules.

**Winter Semester**: are 1nd, 3th and 7th semester modules.

You can find all my personal exam preparation materials in this folder. Organized by winter & summer semester courses (from 3rd till 7th semester + applied math materials). Usually, the most important files in each course are the Cheat-sheet and solved previous exams, if there are any.

If you find yourself lost after reading a certain file, you're more than welcome to send me, and we could go through the file together Insha'Allah.
